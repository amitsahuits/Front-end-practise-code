    <p>this is another demonstration of selector <strong>see this also red because we deifine paragraph style color to red </strong> </p>
    
    <p id="greenelement">But this also possible to write paragraph with different color by giving that a unique id "this is also para but having that id</p>

    <p id="clspara" class="myclass">But we should also use classes that is good practise <em>this para i made by using classes and id both </em></p>

<!-- these are grouped elements -->

    <div>THis is div tag and its color and background color is different because i grouped div along with <em>span and footer they will also be same like this</em></div>

    <br>
    <br><footer>this is also grouped with div and span</footer>
